[gzredux]
"gzredux" is a reorganization of gzdoom, with easier user management with better organization. gzredux has also
improved user friendliness by adding readmes in all file folders. 
It must be made clear that gzredux has in no way added or removed content.

gzredux was created by PlanetOrca, and the only official place to download this is directly from the GitHub page.
Modified downloads from other locations (external link sharing, flash drives, etc) will not receive technical
support or assistance. If external sharing is unmodified and is identical to vanilla files, I may be willing
to help.

When you share this, either by unmodified file sharing or by GitHub links, you agree to credit me, PlanetOrca, as
the creator of gzredux. Modifying this license file will result in any benefit of a legitimate copy of gzredux

For assistance, contact PlanetOrca at realplanetorca@gmail.com and the subject must read "[gzredux] - *insert rest
of subject here*"
