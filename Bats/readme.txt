[gzredux]
This is for advanced automation in gzdoom usage, and .bat files go here. You can use bat files to create premade commands that automate hosting and joining games,
or using addons.
You can use any normal .bat that you would use for gzdoom, except you have to add .lnk to the end in the .bat file. You also need to add a shortcut to gzdoom here
