This is for advanced automation in gzdoom usage, and .bat files go here. You can use bat files to create premade commands that automate hosting and joining games,
or using addons. First, you need to create a shortcut to gzdoom. You can use any normal .bat that you would use for gzdoom, except you have to write
gzdoom.exe.lnk in the .bat file.
